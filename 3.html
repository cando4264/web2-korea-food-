<h2>Korea Island Food</h2>
<p>
  Korean cuisine is largely based on rice,
  vegetables, and (at least in the South) meats.
  Traditional Korean meals are named for the number
  of side dishes (반찬; 飯饌; banchan) that accompany
  steam-cooked short-grain rice. Kimchi is served
  at nearly every meal. Commonly used ingredients
  include sesame oil, doenjang (fermented bean paste),
  soy sauce, salt, garlic, ginger, gochutgaru (pepper flakes),
  gochujang (fermented red chili paste) and napa cabbage.
