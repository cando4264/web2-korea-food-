  Korean cuisine is the customary cooking traditions
  and practices of the culinary arts of Korea.
  Korean cuisine has evolved through centuries
  of social and political change. Originating
  from ancient agricultural and nomadic traditions
  in Korea and southern Manchuria, Korean cuisine has evolved
  through a complex interaction of the natural environment
  and different cultural trends.[1][2]
